2. Property ... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance. 

What does this Vue warning message mean? Can you safely ignore it? What causes it, and how do you fix it ? 

Well, my first explanation would be based on the shopping cart example when I tried to run it but couldn't. 
Because I need to use the computed method which uses properties and is known as the Vue instance.

It means that the method "total" is accessed on the template, but it is not defined in the script.
To fix that we need to define the value in another component.
